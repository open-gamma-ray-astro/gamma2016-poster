\section{Conclusions}

In early 2016, we have started the \gadf effort to create an open forum (mailing list, Github, meetings) and eventually open and common data formats for space- and ground-based gamma-ray instruments. This effort is similar to the HEASARC FITS working group from the 1990s, but this time driven mainly by the movement of ground-based gamma-ray observatories toward producing high-level gamma-ray data in FITS format (IACT DL3 data). We invite everyone interested in this topic to join the mailing list, regular meetings and to contribute or give feedback on how the current formats could be improved to support your use cases.
